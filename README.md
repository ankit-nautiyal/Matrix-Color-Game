# Matrix Color Game

A simple React-based game where you click boxes in a 3x3 matrix to change their colors and watch a sequence unfold!

## How to Play

Welcome to the Matrix Color Game! Follow these steps to play:

1. **The Matrix**: Start with a 3x3 matrix of 9 white boxes.
2. **Click to Turn Green**: Click any white box to turn it green. Each box can only be clicked onceâ€”additional clicks on a green box do nothing.
3. **Fill the Matrix**: Continue clicking different boxes until all 9 are green.
4. **Orange Sequence**: When you click the last white box (making all 9 green), it turns green, and after a 1-second pause, all boxes turn orange one by one in the order you originally clicked them, with a 2-second delay between each.
5. **Reset and Replay**: Click the "Reset" button below the matrix at any timeâ€”before, during, or after the sequenceâ€”to turn all boxes back to white and start over.

**Goal**: Enjoy clicking the boxes and watching the color sequence! Thereâ€™s no scoreâ€”just have fun with the pattern!ðŸ™‚
